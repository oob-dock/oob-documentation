      summary: Cancel payment initiation.
      operationId: paymentsPatchPixPaymentsPaymentId
      description: >
        This endpoint should be used to cancel transactions, at the payer's request, that are in one of the following statuses: Successfully Scheduled (SCHD), Pending for Review (PDNG), or Awaiting Multiple Approvals (PATC).

        - If the request is successful, the transaction will move to the CANC status.

        - If the payment status is different from SCHD/PDNG/PATC or if any other business rule prevents the cancellation, the PATCH request returns HTTP Status 422 with the code PAGAMENTO_NAO_PERMITE_CANCELAMENTO.

        - If a 422 is received, the initiator should make a GET request on the payment to check its current status and associated details.

        Payment cancellation must be sent by 11:59 PM (Brasilia Time) on the day before the payment execution date.

                          A URN, as defined in [RFC8141](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141), is a Uniform Resource Identifier - URI - assigned under the "urn" URI scheme and a specific URN namespace, with the intent that the URN be a persistent and location-independent resource identifier.

                          Considering the string urn:bancoex:C1DD33123 as an example for consentId, we have:

                      [RFC8141](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8141) is a Uniform Resource

                      Identifier - URI - that is assigned under the URI scheme "urn" and a specific URN namespace, with the intention that the URN

                      be a persistent and location-independent resource identifier.

                      Considering the string urn:bancoex:C1DD33123 as an example for consentId, we have:

                      - the namespace(urn)
